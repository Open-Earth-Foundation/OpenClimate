# OpenClimate

[OpenClimate](https://openclimate.network/) is a data utility for tracking climate action.

It provides a database and API for current and historical CO2 emissions data, emissions reduction targets, climate plans and actions, and geographical, demographic and economic contextual data.

It covers climate actors of all kinds, including countries, regions and provinces, cities, companies, down to specific emissions sites like factories and mines. OpenClimate connects these actors by geographic, political or business relationships to provided nested climate accounting.

The data explorer Web interface lets you discover and compare actors in this network.
