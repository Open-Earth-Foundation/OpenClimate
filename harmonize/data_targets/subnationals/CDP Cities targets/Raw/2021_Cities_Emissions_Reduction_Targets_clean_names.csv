En detalle, las emisiones cubiertas son: - Energía Estacionaria, alcances 1 y 2 - Transporte, alcance 1 (se utiliza el método de venta de combustible) y 2- Residuos, alcance 1 y 3Se decidió no incorporar las emisiones de agricultura y ganadería y las emisiones de alcance 3 de energía estacionaria (incluidas en el inventario) ya que sobre estas, los gobiernos locales no tienen capacidad de realizar acciones concretas para mitigarlas.

Por otro lado, las emisiones proyectadas al año 2030 bajo el escenario BAU ascienden a 592 MtCO2e . De esta forma, el aumento porcentual relativo de emisiones proyectado para el 2030 es del 60,87%. Este aumento será considerado para la preparación del escenario BAU de General Alvear donde se proyectarán las emisiones alcanzadas por el nivel BÁSICO. Como se mostró en el punto 3.2.1.6, éste nivel abarca los sectores en los cuales los gobiernos locales poseen mayor capacidad de realizar acciones concretas, y que pueden ser gestionados más fácilmente que los incluidos en el nivel BÁSICO+. Para correlacionar el escenario Business as Usual nacional con el de General Alvear se realizó un ajuste considerando las tasas de aumento poblacional. El factor de ajuste es equivalente a la relación entre la variación poblacional en el período 2014-2030 a nivel nacional y local. Factor de ajuste=  (variación población 2014-2030 General Alvear)/(variación población 2014-2030 Argentina)El INDEC estima que durante este tiempo la población argentina aumentará un 15,79%  y un 8,98%  en el municipio. Por lo tanto el factor de ajuste resulta de 0,57. Así, el aumento de emisiones proyectado para General Alvear será del 34,63%.

As such, the energy consumption per unit for buildings can be accurately grasped. In addition, the City promotes the use of recycled and circular materials for public and private construction projects, driving the circular economy.2.Improve green transportation: The City will increase the shared ratio of green transportation to over 70% by 2030. The road network of Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) will continue to be constructed with optimization of connecting bus routes. The City also promotes the “4U Green Shared Transport” by encouraging the use of shared vehicles such as Ubike, Ucar, Umotor, and Uparking.3.Advance the electrification of vehicles: The City will raise its subsidies for citizens to purchase electric motorcycles, aiming to achieve more than 30% of shared ratio of electric motorcycles by 2030. It also aims to reach 100% all-electric city buses by 2030. To establish a user-friendly environment for electric vehicles, the City will accelerate the construction of charging infrastructures.4.Installation of renewable energy systems: The City will expand the installed capacity of photovoltaic system, accelerating the pace of setting up civic power plants. Furthermore, it plans to introduce hydrogen energy use and novel energy storage systems.5.Investment in green and innovative industries: Through the partnership with private venture capital management consulting companies, the Industrial Development Fund of Taipei City will prioritize climate-related venture capital, facilitating the development of relevant industries and attracting private investment funds.6.Promote low-carbon and sustainable procurement: The City establishes the regulations with public sector taking leadership in purchasing low-carbon certified products with environmental and energy-efficient labels, and regulates labor services and engineering contract partners to use low-carbon products.",2602418,2020,"POINT (121.564 25.0375)","2021-10-04T09:30:14.243","Taipei","City","TWN"

Wastewater treatment systems are an important source of GHG emissions, so the determination of their GHG emission rates has become an important issue for their control.In the particular case of CH4, as it is the main compound of biogas generated in wastewater treatment systems, it is possible to use this resource in different processes for both combustion engines, lighting and refrigeration systems, as well as for industrial and domestic burners, so various techniques are proposed for their measurement and monitoring either directly on the surface and / or below the water level.Under this context, the municipality of San Isidro is proposing to enable a second Treatment Plant for the irrigation of green areas which would be located on Godofredo García street block 4.

However, the level of these budgets is not aligned to the Paris Agreement. The WMCA target goes beyond the ambition of the 2008 Climate Change Act, the current recommendations of the UK Government’s advisory body the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). This is primarily due to two key differences between our approach and that of the CCC to date:a) The equity principles of the Paris Agreement and wider UNFCCC process are explicitly and quantitatively applied. Our approach allocates a smaller share of the global carbon budget to the ‘developed country Parties’, such as the UK, relative to ‘developing country Parties’. b) Carbon removals via negative emissions technologies (NETs) are not included. The CCC include a significant role for NETs such as bioenergy carbon capture and storage and direct air capture in their analysis. Doing so increases the size of a carbon budget compatible with a given global temperature target. However carbon removal technologies are at a very early stage of development and whether they can be successfully deployed at sufficient scale is highly uncertain. These sub-national carbon budgets are therefore more precautionary than the current advice from the Committee on Climate Change.The UK carbon budget to be at the upper end of the range that is aligned with the Paris Agreement’s objectives. Early results from the latest Earth system models suggest that the climate may be more sensitive to greenhouse gases than previously thought implying a smaller global carbon budget is required. In addition, assuming that developing countries will, on aggregate, implement rapid emissions reduction measures in line with a 2025 peak year is far from certain. Therefore, we recommend that these sub-national budgets are taken as reflective of the minimum commitment required to deliver on the Paris Agreement.",2939927,2020,NA,"2021-10-04T09:30:14.243","West Midlands","City","GBR"

The City of Atlanta has adopted similar targets (except theirs was for a 2009 baseline).

Consumption emissions statistics have higher uncertainty than territorial-based emissions due to the large amount of national accounts and trade data needed in addition to GHG inventories to map the global flows of intermediate goods and services which provide inputs for a final product consumed in the UK.  However, for the first time consumption-based emissions accounting has been included in this submission at borough level, providing an overview of trends in the period 2001 – 2018 (see previous section). The results show that Wandsworth has significantly reduced consumption emissions during this period. But we recognise emissions relating to lifestyles will make up an increasing proportion of our residents' carbon footprint and therefore have joined the pan-London programme One World Living and committed to reducing consumption based emissions by two thirds.  Further work is being undertaken to develop a more granular understanding of lifestyles in London that can support effective interventions and policy recommendations and as this is a new target there is no specific progress. Whilst we only agreed this target in 2021, the action plans agreed at the start of 2020 and refreshed in 2021 recognise the need to decarbonise across the borough. As such, the bulk of the action plans have always been geared towards influencing the lifestyles or our residents as we are aware that consumption emissions make up a large proportion of the borough's overall footprint.

Many local governments do not have access to sufficient historical data to prepare a 1990 baseline emissions inventory, which would allow local governments to establish reduction targets that exactly mimic the state’s own targets. In its 2008 Scoping Plan, the ARB “encourages local governments to adopt a reduction goal for municipal operations emissions and move toward establishing similar goals for community emissions that parallel the state’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 15 percent from current levels by 2020.” Based on this language, many community-wide CAPs have selected a reduction target of 15% below baseline levels by 2020 to parallel the state’s target. Considering guidance from the Governor's Office of Planning and Research and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District at the time of CAP document preparation, Cupertino selected a reduction target of 15% below 2010 baseline levels by 2020 as a proxy for a return to 1990 levels.

The plant supplies approximately 10% of petroleum requirements in the Philippines through the production of 30 million liters of ethanol each year, and production of 8MW of renewable energy from the sugarcane by-product, bagasse and other renewable fuels, is more than sufficient to satisfy the process energy needs of the project. Aside from the Ethanol Plant, the San Carlos Eco-Zone also hosts the first large scale solar power plant in the country – the San Carlos Solar Energy Plant (SACASOL), the 35-hectare solar farm is composed of around 175,000 panels that produce a total of 45 MW of solar power. The 2nd Solar Plant, the San Carlos Sun Power, Inc. (SACASUN), has just completed the construction and commissioning of its 59-MW solar power project in San Carlos and is now exporting power to the Visayas grid. Another renewable energy project is the San Carlos BioPower an 19 MW biopower plant fuelled by sugarcane trash is set to be completed next year.  The biomass project concept is to build a greenfield, stand-alone plant. The plant is designed to utilize 100% cane field residues (or cane trash), the most abundant biomass in the area, and can be supplemented by other types of biomass from agricultural wastes and dedicated energy crops.

Under an annual reduction of 22.3% per year (2020 to 2028) remaining emissions under this pathway would be 385,000tCO2 cumulatively through to 2100, which is 5% of the carbon budget of 7.7 million tonnes. For the most part, reducing the principal sources of CO2 would significantly lower CO2e, and our Carbon Neutral Action Plan aims to reduce all greenhouse gases and scopes where possible. Progress is reported as 0% as emissions data as this target was only introduced in 2019. CO2 emissions data also has a 2 year lag, and as such, 2019 emissions are the most recent known. Between 2005 and 2019, Nottingham's emissions have decreased by 44.2%.",337098,2020,NA,"2021-10-04T09:30:14.243","Nottingham","City","GBR"

Many municipalities nationwide have taken the first steps in this direction. However, the production of solid waste per inhabitant continues to increase as well as the percentage of this waste that ends up in a sanitary landfill, generating among many problems that the values of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) associated with solid waste are still very high. More work is needed to reduce the amount of waste that currently ends up in transfer plants nationwide. The key is not only to increase recycling values at the local or district level but to give them value through proper management. Currently, the economic system that accompanies recycling is radically faced with the life cycle of nature and sustainable development, both concepts focused on long-term processes. In that sense Jesus Maria is  establishing guidelines for the continuous reuse of resources, thus reducing the consequences for future generations. Taking the cyclical model of nature as an example, the circular economy is presented as a system of resource use where the reduction of the elements prevails: minimizing production to the indispensable minimum, and when it is necessary to make use of the product, betting on the reuse of the elements that due to their properties cannot return to the environment. Jesus Maria  focus on implementing an integrated system of treatment (segregation at the source, selective collection, recovery and reuse) of organic waste generated in the district as an alternative to reducing the amounts of waste generated for final disposal, and whose reuse contributes to living in harmony with the environment and reducing the ecological footprint, in order to achieve a healthy life and a resilient district, in compliance with the goals, plans and legal framework for solid waste.- Reduce the generation of solid waste at the municipal level: Environmental awareness, inspection, support regulations, etc.- Strengthen selective collection: Installation of Clean Points, improve collection systems and public cleaning, articulation of efforts with formalization of recyclers, etc.- Reuse of resources and raw materials: Recovery of solid waste, technological waste, composting, infrastructure, etc.",75359,2019,NA,"2021-10-04T09:30:14.243","Jesús María","City","PER"

A scenario development approach was adopted:  A ‘“Business-as-Usual’” scenario and two “pathways” of ambitious action under optimistic (“Green Economy”) and pessimistic (“Ambition under Limited Mandate and Opportunity”) conditions were modelled. The target reported here is informed by these two scenarios. The emissions modelling for the various scenarios also builds on the previous energy and emissions modelling carried out by the City for the Energy2040 Goal adopted by Council in 2015.Alignment with national targets: The current national NDC target does not extend to 2050 but the ‘PPD’ policy line it is based on would imply a 9 – 19MT range for CCT. This target is therefore more ambitious than current national targets. The draft update to the national NDC has however ramped up medium term national ambition but still does not extend to 2050. The draft updated NDC targets involve keeping emissions between 398-510 Mt CO2-eq.  between 2021 and 2025 narrowing to a range of 398-440 Mt CO2-eq. between 2026 and 2030. This implies a peaking of emissions before 2026 and a reduction in the upper bound of the emissions envelope of 14%. The City of Cape Town’s new target will align well with this new national ambition once the draft NDC is approved. South Africa has coal intensive grid power and relatively high transport emissions and so attaining the target is highly dependent on cleaning the grid and electrifying transport, especially an expanded public transport network, off the back of that.Modelling with the C40 Pathways tool gave outcomes either side of this for different scenarios.

Consumption emissions statistics have higher uncertainty than territorial-based emissions due to the large amount of national accounts and trade data needed in addition to GHG inventories to map the global flows of intermediate goods and services which provide inputs for a final product consumed in the UK.  However, for the first time consumption-based emissions accounting has been included in this submission at borough level, providing an overview of trends in the period 2001 – 2018 (see previous section). The results show that Richmond has significantly reduced consumption emissions during this period. But we recognise emissions relating to lifestyles will make up an increasing proportion of our residents' carbon footprint and therefore have joined the pan-London programme One World Living and committed to reducing consumption based emissions by two thirds.  Further work is being undertaken to develop a more granular understanding of lifestyles in London that can support effective interventions and policy recommendations and as this is a new target there is no specific progress. Whilst we only agreed this target in 2021, the action plans agreed at the start of 2020 and refreshed in 2021 recognise the need to decarbonise across the borough.

A scenario development approach was adopted:  A ‘“Business-as-Usual’” scenario and two “pathways” of ambitious action under optimistic (“Green Economy”) and pessimistic (“Ambition under Limited Mandate and Opportunity”) conditions were modelled.  The target reported here is informed by these two scenarios. The emissions modelling for the various scenarios also builds on the previous energy and emissions modelling carried out by the City for the Energy2040 Goal adopted by Council in 2015.Alignment with national targets: The current national NDC target entails a stable lower limit and a slightly rising upper limit to 2030. The NDC is however under review and the draft update has emissions peaking in 2025. When this draft NDC is approved the City of Cape Town target will be in-line with the new national ambition. South Africa has coal intensive grid power and so the electricity supply sector carries the greatest burden of the target. Sector shares are as follows:Electricity Supply: 1MT CO2e requiring 400 MW of new utility scale renewable electricity supply and annual small scale embedded generation of 300 GWh.Buildings: 0.25 MT energy efficiency retrofits. Building SSEG in Electricity aboveWaste: 0.5 MT from diversion of organics from landfill, flaring and biogas to powerTransport: 0.25 MT from rehabilitation of the rail system, expansion of the high quality bus system, reduction of single occupancy vehicle use, vehicle efficiency improvement and moderate electrification.The target took modelling using C40’s Pathways Tool into consideration but also the uncertainties of the local political economy and the as yet new and untested legislative framework that could allow South African cities to procure their own renewable electricity.

Manchester's carbon budget was calculated by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in June 2018, proposed by Manchester Climate Change Agency in October 2018, and formally adopted by Manchester City Council, on behalf of the city, in November 2018.The adopted carbon budget relates to the total remaining amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) from energy use within the local authority area that Manchester should limit its emissions to in order to meet its goal of making a ‘fair contribution’ to the United Nations Paris Agreement on Climate Change. This carbon budget was set on the basis of a report by Kuriakose et al which used the latest science and the principle of equity within the Paris Agreement to determine a remaining budget for Manchester for the 2018 to 2100 period. The report, as well as providing a quantification of the remaining carbon budget for Manchester, also includes five-yearly interim carbon budget periods and proposes an emissions reduction pathway with an average annual reduction rate. The report  is based on an approach to setting local carbon budgets developed as part of the Department of Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) funded SCATTER project in 2017/18. This underlying approach also recommended that the carbon budget is reviewed “on a five-yearly basis to reflect the most up to date science, any changes in global agreements on climate mitigation and progress on the successful deployment at scale of negative emissions  technologies.”http://www.manchesterclimate.com/sites/default/files/Appendix%202%20-%20Quantifying%20the%20Implications%20of%20the%20Paris%20Agreement%20to%20Manchester%202018_0.pdfIn late-2019/early-2020 the Agency commissioned the Tyndall Centre to review the city's targets, in relation to:- Direct emissions- Indirect / consumption-based emissions, and- Aviation emissionsThe review and it recommendations was used to inform the development of the objctives and targets  in the Manchester Climate Change Framework 2020-25.

El factor de ajuste es equivalente a la relación entre la variación poblacional en el período 2014-2030 a nivel nacional y local. Factor de ajuste = (variación población 2014 − 2030 San Martín de los Andes)/(variación población 2014 − 2030 Argentina)El INDEC estima que durante este tiempo la población argentina aumentará un 15,79% y un 27,59% en el municipio. Por lo tanto, el factor de ajuste resulta de 1,7471. Así, el aumento de emisiones proyectado para San Martín de los Andes será del 106,35%. Aumento de emisiones en San Martín de los Andes 2014 − 2030 (%) = 60,87% ∗ 1,7471= 106,35%Tomando de base el inventario BÁSICO de San Martín de los Andes del 2014, las emisiones proyectadas bajo el escenario tendencial al 2030 serán de 486.354,76 tCO2e. Emisiones San Martín de los Andes al 2030 (tCO2e) =  235.696,09 tCO2e ∗ (1 + 1,7471) = 486.354,76 tCO2e Tomando como referencia la meta de reducción de emisiones presentada por el país y acorde a lo establecido en el Pacto de Alcaldes por el Clima y la Energía, San Martín de los Andes se compromete a reducir sus emisiones de gases de efecto en al menos un 18% respecto al escenario BAU al 2030, considerando las fuentes de emisión del alcance BÁSICO.  De esta forma, en 2030, San Martín de los Andes no emitirá más de 398.810,90 tCO2e.","Do not know","No","Se espera que la reducción de emisiones propuesta por San Martín de los Andes y las medidas que se desarrollen para su concreción, se sumen a los esfuerzos nacionales.",37078,2018,NA,"2021-10-04T09:30:14.243","San Martín de los Andes","City","ARG"

Data from the 2014 emissions inventory was used to create the model to set the city's baseline emissions. CURB is an excel based model that uses city emission inventory data to project future emissions and suggest actions for reduction. The analysis presented here comes from the CURB model, and it helped Amman shape its 2050 vision and action plan. The tool was developed closely with the departments and units that manage infrastructure projects and policies in the Greater Amman Municipality; the government formed a technical working group that input data to the model. The selected actions used to create the scenario are based on discussions with these departments and reflect the city's actions that are in process. The baseline scenario is a ""business as usual"" projection that estimates what emission levels would be in the future with no emission reduction actions. The baseline uses Amman's 2014 emissions inventory data and future population and economic growth rates to project emissions. Actions were then selected in the tool for each sector to build a scenario that would reduce emissions below the baseline emission projections. Currently, the model pathway does not show that Amman can reach its 2050 near-zero-emissions target. C40 considers near-zero-emissions to be 0.01 tCO2e/person.

AB 32 also directed the Air Resources Board (ARB) to develop and implement regulations that reduce statewide GHG emissions. Many local governments do not have access to sufficient historical data to prepare a 1990 baseline emissions inventory, which would allow local governments to establish reduction targets that exactly mimic the state’s own targets. In its 2008 Scoping Plan, the ARB “encourages local governments to adopt a reduction goal for municipal operations emissions and move toward establishing similar goals for community emissions that parallel the state’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 15 percent from current levels by 2020.” Based on this language, many community-wide CAPs have selected a reduction target of 15% below baseline levels by 2020 to parallel the state’s target. Considering guidance from the Governor's Office of Planning and Research and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District at the time of CAP document preparation, Cupertino selected a reduction target of 15% below 2010 baseline levels by 2020 as a proxy for a return to 1990 levels.

New Zealand's NDC under the Paris Agreement is a 30% reduction below 2005 levels by 2030. Furthermore, the Zero Carbon Bill was passed by Parliament in May 2019, and came into effect December 2019, which legislates for net zero GHG emissions by 2050, excluding biogenic methane - biogenic methane is to be reduced between 24-47%  below 2017 levels by 2050.
