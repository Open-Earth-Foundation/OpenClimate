As of 2018, the statistics cover the years 2009-2016, and CO2, N2O and CH4. The statistics does not provide municipalities with information about activity data, but for some sources the emission factor is given. Towards 2019, The Norwegian environment agency and Statistics Norway work to further improve the data. A more detailed model for calculating emissions for road traffic is developed, and municipalities will receive data on the LULUCF-sector  (land use, land use change and forestry) excluding HWP (harvested wood products) for the years 2010 and 2015. The statistics for the whole time-series will be recalculated when these projects are finalized winter 2018/2019. Level of confidence for scope 1 emissions will then shift from medium to high.
