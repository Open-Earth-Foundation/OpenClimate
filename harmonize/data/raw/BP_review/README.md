## Description

Carbon emissions from primary energy use are estimated by applying the Default CO2 Emission ‎Factors for Combustion to the consumption of each energy product type (coal, natural gas and ‎various oil products) from the list of IPCC emission factors. Biofuels are considered as not emitting ‎CO2, consistent with the practice of the IEA. Second, the revised method takes account of fuel ‎consumption used for non-combustion purposes, such as the use of oil products and natural gas in ‎the petrochemicals industry or of oil to produce bitumen for road construction. Estimates of the ‎share of non-combusted fossil fuels taken from the IEA’s energy balances are subtracted from the ‎total consumption of fossil fuels before applying the relevant emission factors.


Carbon ‎emissions from flared natural gas are calculated using data series on volumes of gas flared from two sources: Cedigaz up to 2012, and the ‎Payne Institute for Public Policy, Colorado School of Mines, from 2013 onward. Payne Institute’s data ‎include flaring from upstream, downstream oil and gas, while Cedigaz include flaring from upstream ‎only. Volumes of gas flared have been standardised using a Gross Calorific Value (GCV) of 40 MJ/m3. ‎The IPCC Default CO2 Emission Factor for Combustion for natural gas (56,100 kg CO2 per TJ) is used ‎and perfect combustion has been assumed. These emissions represent around 1% of total CO2 ‎emissions.‎


Data for methane emissions associated with the production, transportation and distribution of fossil fuels for 1990-2020 are sourced, where available, from IEA (2021, 2022) Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Energy (all rights reserved). For a selected number of fossil fuel-producing countries where methane emission data is not currently available, an estimate of historical methane emissions has been derived using regional average methane intensity of production. For 2021, methane emission estimates are derived for all countries using methane intensity of fossil fuel production in 2020. Total methane emissions at a global and regional level show a discrepancy with IEA data due to non-inclusion of residual emissions i.e. emissions which have not been allocated to named countries. There is a wide range of uncertainty with respect to both current estimates of methane emissions and the global warming potential of methane emissions. To ensure alignment with financial and government reporting standards, the methane to CO2e factor is a 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 25, recommended by the IPCC in AR4.


Carbon emissions from industrial processes refer only to non-energy CO2 emissions from cement production and are sourced for 1990-2021 from Andrew, R. M. (2019) Global CO2 emissions from cement production, 1928-2018. Earth System Science Data 11, 1675-1710, (updated dataset May 2022).
