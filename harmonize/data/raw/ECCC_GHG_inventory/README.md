## Description
Canada’s official national greenhouse gas inventory is prepared and submitted annually to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ([UNFCCC](https://unfccc.int/)) by April 15 of each year, in accordance with the revised [Guidelines]((https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/transparency-and-reporting/reporting-and-review-under-the-convention/greenhouse-gas-inventories-annex-i-parties/reporting-requirements)) for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention, Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories (UNFCCC Reporting Guidelines), adopted through [Decision 24/CP.19](https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2013/cop19/eng/10a03.pdf#page=2) in 2013. The annual inventory submission consists of the National Inventory Report (NIR) and the Common Reporting Format (CRF) tables. Gases for which emissions are estimated include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Note that to account for the creation of Nunavut in 1999, data for years preceding 1999 show Nunavut and Northwest Territories as a combined region.
