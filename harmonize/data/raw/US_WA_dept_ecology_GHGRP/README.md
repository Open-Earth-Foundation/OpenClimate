## Description
This dataset contains data reported to Ecology as of January 12, 2022. The reported emissions are preliminary and have not been fully verified by Ecology. This information is subject to change.

Certain large facilities and transportation fuel suppliers are required to report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to Ecology beginning with the 2012 emissions year. Owners or operators of the following are required to report:
- Facilities that emit at least 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) of greenhouse gases per year in Washington.
- Suppliers of liquid motor vehicle fuel, special fuel, or aircraft fuel that supply products equivalent to at least 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year in Washington.

Sources are grouped by sectors. Most sectors focus on each facility’s onsite emissions. The transportation fuel supplier sector describes emissions associated with the complete combustion or oxidation of fuels supplied by transportation fuel suppliers under the Washington Department of Licensing Fuel Tax Program.

This dataset does not include all of Washington’s emissions. See the [Washington State Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory](https://ecology.wa.gov/Air-Climate/Climate-change/Climate-change-the-environment/Science) for statewide emissions totals.

Emissions are in units of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents using AR4 global warming potentials as specified in WAC 173-441.
