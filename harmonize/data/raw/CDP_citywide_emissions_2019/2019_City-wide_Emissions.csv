The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.  Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle.

Sektor proses industri dan penggunaan produk tidak termasuk dalam ruang lingkup inventarisasi karena karena data terkait sektor ini seperti penggunaan pelumas di sub sektor transportasi dan industri belum dapat diidentifikasi di Kota Malang. Jenis gas yang dilaporkan dari sektor-sektor penyumbang/penyerap emisi terdiri dari gas karbondioksida (CO2), gas metana (CH4) dan gas dinitro oksida (N2O).Hasil inventarisasi ini selanjutnya digunakan sebagai acuan bagi perencanaan terpadu dalam upaya menurunkan emisi GRK. Upaya penurunan GRK sebagaimana komitmen nasional dilakukan dengan mempertimbangkan skenario kenaikan emisi di masa yang akan datang.Berdasarkan total kontribusi kumulatifnya, maka sekitar 42% sumber emisi dikontribusikan oleh sektor penggunaan listrik pemukiman (sektor energi lainnya).

Es importante recalcar que como menciona el GPC, la cuantificación y el reporte justo y real de emisiones de GEI  de una ciudad o municipio están basados en cinco principios fundamentales que incluyen: la relevancia, la exhaustividad, la coherencia, la transparencia y la precisión. Por otra parte  para el inventario con el que se cuenta 2012-2015 (recopilación de datos en 2012, se elaboró en 2013,  y finalmente se publicó en 2015) se aplicó la metodología del IPCC 2006 y Factores de Emisión (FE), en los que se presentan adecuaciones puntuales en respuesta a las características específicas de las actividades productivas en León; por mencionar algunas consideraciones, además se incluyó la producción artesanal de tabique, con apego a las disposiciones estipuladas en el Programa Especial de Cambio Climático (PECC).

In this way, the results described in the following chapters are intended to be comparable and acceptable on a global scale.The inventory prepared at the urban scale includes all the emission sources within the realm of authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality. The authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality covers the provincial boundaries of the province .The inventory content is based on the classification of emission sources set by GPC. When preparing inventory in the framework of GPC, the scope of the inventory was determined depending on the detail, accuracy and reliability of the available data. GPC evaluates greenhouse gas emissions in 3 scopes; Scope 1 - Direct Emissions, Scope 2 - Indirect Emissions and Scope 3 - Indirect (Consumption Based) Emissions. During the preparation of the inventory, all emission sources within the realm of authority of the municipality were scanned and the maximum amount of data was tried to be reached. The emissions under Scope 3 were not included in the inventory due to the fact that it is ver y difficult to reach related data . According to the results of the GPC approach, the total greenhouse gas emissions of Denizli province for the year 2016 were estimated to be 7.5 million tons of CO2e. This amount refers to 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita, which is proportional to the population of Denizli in the same year (1.005.687) and this number is higher than Turkey’s 2016 average calculated as 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita.

The Bilan Carbone accordingly provides an overview on the various emission sources and their contributions to climate change. By employing this method, the GHG emissions from different types of reduction scenarios can be estimated, and thereby helps to identify appropriate and effective action plans and/or policies as well as potential implementation options to reduce GHG emissions.The Bilan Carbone method is somewhat similar to the techniques of “Rapid asessment of sources of air, water and land pollution” which are primarily based on the magnitude of emission sources and emission factors. The cores of Bilan Carbone tool are workbooks and spreadsheets in MS. Excel with ready-made calculating and converting formulas. All emission factors are arranged in a separate spreadsheet and linked to corresponding cells in other ones.

Its analysis covers all of six GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs and PFCs) mentioned in Kyoto protocol, CFCs and water vapor released into the stratosphere by airplanes. The Bilan Carbone accordingly provides an overview on the various emission sources and their contributions to climate change. By employing this method, the GHG emissions from different types of reduction scenarios can be estimated, and thereby helps to identify appropriate and effective action plans and/or policies as well as potential implementation options to reduce GHG emissions.The Bilan Carbone method is somewhat similar to the techniques of “Rapid asessment of sources of air, water and land pollution” which are primarily based on the magnitude of emission sources and emission factors. The cores of Bilan Carbne tool are workbooks and spreadsheets in MS. Excel with ready-made calculating and converting formulas. All emission factors are arranged in a separate spreadsheet and linked to corresponding cells in other ones.

It is designated that the 2010 is the base year for emission, however, due to lack of information from past years, some indicators has not been included in this report.  At the community level, the main sources of emissions are the burning of fossil fuels for carbon dioxide emissions, automotive exhaust for nitrous oxide emissions and landfills for methane emissions.   The calculation includes three main sources of GHG emissions: 1) Direct emissions from the burning of fossil fuels 2) Indirect emissions from the production of electricity from electricity generation plants 3) The decomposition of biomass to greenhouse gases in landfills The results are presented into sub-sectors; residential, commercial, industry and agriculture for fuel combustion and electricity usage. The standard unit of “equivalent CO2” is used to report the emissions. All sources have one or more associated emission factors for quantify the energy burned in the all three main sectors - buildings, electricity, on-road transportation, solid waste.  A Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) is a quantification of the amount of CO2 emitted due to energy consumption and waste disposal in the territory of a Local Authority within a given period of time. The BEI allows identifying the main CO2 sources on the municipality’s territory, thus helping to select the appropriate actions to curb emissions. The Baseline year is the reference year for setting the objective!  MBMB decided year 2010 as baseline year and calculated the emission for emission sources in Melaka City. The total emission was 1.74 mil tCO2 equivalents.  The highest emitter was transportation sector which is 0.68 mil tCO2, followed by waste sector 0.57 mil tCO2, residential and commercial were 0.26 and 0.22 mil tCO2 respectively.",,"CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs, SF6",,,,,,,,,,,,This is our first year of calculation,Lack of resource / funding overcome,,524353,2018,,2020-05-01T03:57:57.217

The City does not have a power plant within its geographical boundaries and its electricity is solely sourced from the Manila Electric Company (MERALCO). Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity consumption are classified as indirect or Scope 2 emissions, if the power plants producing the electricity are physically located outside the geographic boundaries of an LGU. For transportation related emissions the methodology is modeled after IPCC’s ‘tier 1’ approach due to current limitations in data availability.  GHG emissions are therefore estimated using relatively aggregated input data on fuel use, combined with default emission factors by fuel.  Only road transportation emissions are included in the GHG inventory since there are no airports or harbors in the geographical boundary of the City of Santa Rosa. For solid wastes, it is based on the First Order Decay method.
