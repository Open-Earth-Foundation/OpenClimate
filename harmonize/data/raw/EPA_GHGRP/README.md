## Description
FLIGHT provides information about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from large facilities in the U.S. These facilities are required to report annual data about GHG emissions to EPA as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). This data set does not reflect total U.S. GHG emissions. The data was reported to EPA by facilities as of 08/12/2022. EPA continues to quality assure data and plans to release updated data periodically.
