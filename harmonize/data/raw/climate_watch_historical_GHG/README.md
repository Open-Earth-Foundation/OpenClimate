## Description
Historical country-level and sectoral GHG emissions data (1990-2019)

Climate Watch Historical Emissions data contains sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for 194 countries and the European Union for the period 1990-2019, including emissions of the six major GHGs from most major sources and sinks. Non-CO2 emissions are expressed in CO2 equivalents using 100-year global warming potential values from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.
Population and GDP values are extracted from the World Bank Databank Development Indicators.
We are in the process of updating our old methodology, but users can read our [temporary methodology here](https://wri-sites.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/climatewatch.org/www.climatewatch.org/climate-watch/wri_metadata/NDC_methodology.pdf).

**caution** Climate Watch Historical GHG Emissions data (previously published through CAIT Climate Data Explorer) are derived from several sources. Any use of the Land-Use Change and Forestry or Agriculture indicator should be cited as FAO 2021, FAOSTAT Emissions Database. Any use of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion data should be cited as CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, OECD/IEA, 2021. As of March 2020, emissions from European Union (27) for all years no longer include emissions from United Kingdom on Climate Watch.
