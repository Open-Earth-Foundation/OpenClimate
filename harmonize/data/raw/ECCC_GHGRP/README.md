## Description
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) collects information on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually from facilities across Canada. It is a mandatory program for those who meet the requirements.

Facilities that emit 10 kilotonnes or more of GHGs, in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent (eq.) units, per year must report their emissions to Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Emissions data are available by gas (in tonnes and tonnes of CO2 eq.) for each facility and each year of data collected (2004-Present). The GHGs included are: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).
