This data is collected through the CDP-ICLEI Unified Reporting System. When using this data, please cite both organisations using the following wording: ‘This data was collected in partnership by CDP and ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability’.

This dataset contains public data on total city-wide emissions as disclosed by cities in 2020. For a full breakdown of cities' emissions by sector and scope, please see the [2020 Full Cities Dataset](https://data.cdp.net/Governance/2020-Full-Cities-Dataset/eja6-zden), with answers from the complete [cities 2020 questionnaire](https://guidance.cdp.net/en/guidance?cid=16&ctype=theme&idtype=ThemeID&incchild=1&microsite=0&otype=Questionnaire&tags=TAG-637%2CTAG-570%2CTAG-13013).

When using the inventory data for aggregation, comparison and trend analysis, please note that the inventory data is based on non-verified self-reported city inputs. The reported inventory may not include all emission sources within the city boundary.
