## Description
The IGES NDC Database compiles the main features of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which were communicated by the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in order to present the targets and measures that will be taken in order to implement the Paris Agreement, according to countriesâ€™ national circumstances. This database summarizes in the master sheet the main climate pledges from each NDC concerning mitigation, or how countries intend to limit their greenhouse has (GHG) emissions to lessen their impact on climate change, and adaptation, or how countries are planning to adapt to the effects of climate change. Other elements are referenced as well, such as financial and technological needs expressed in NDCs, countries GHG emissions, use of various market mechanisms and signatures and ratification of the agreement.
