## Description
The Net Zero Tracker collects information on targets for net zero emissions (and similar aims) pledged by countries, cities, states/regions/provinces (hereafter 'regions' for short), and companies.

It includes two tiers of data collection:

**Tier 1**:

Defined populations for which we include all actors as designated below, whether they include a target or not.
1. All UNFCCC member states, other regions and territories
2. All cities with population greater than 500,000
3. All regions in the top 25-emitting countries
4. All of the 2,000 largest public companies

**Tier 2**:

Other actors included if we find a relevant target.

In aggregate, the data allows for complete claims about the population of entities in Tier 1 (e.g. 'X large cities have Y'), and “at least” claims about the global population (e.g. 'at least Z of all companies in the world have Y').
