## Data Download
Downloaded as Excel file from the [Profit and Emissions Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19MQbZbrCu4HpAWe6NU92CioYQ7KE8FvD9vl-r9qSjJg/edit#gid=1542516770). Then opened with Excel and converted to CSV. Had to do some manipulation within Excel to remove spaces. Note: saving directly as a CSV from the Google Doc was causing some formatting issues. Also, saving as a CSV from any software other than Excel is not guaranteed to work. I was having issues using Apple Numbers.

The file saved here is my cleaned version
