## Description
The term energy-related CO2 emissions refers to emissions released at the location where fossil fuels are consumed. Energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions vary significantly across states, on both an absolute basis and on a per capita basis. Total state CO2 emissions include CO2 emissions from direct fuel use across all sectors, including residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation, as well as primary fuels consumed for electricity generation.
