## Description
The PRIMAP-hist version 2.4 dataset combines several published datasets to create a comprehensive set of greenhouse gas emission pathways for every country and Kyoto gas covering the years 1750 to 2021, and all UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) member states, as well as most non-UNFCCC territories. The data resolves the main IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2006 categories. Subsector data for Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), and Agriculture is available for CO2, CH4, and N2O.
