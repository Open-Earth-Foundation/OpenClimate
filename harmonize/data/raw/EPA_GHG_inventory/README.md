## Description
The Data Explorer is an interactive tool that provides access to data from the EPA's annual Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks and the new Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks by State. You can use the tool to create customized graphs, examine trends over time, and download data. Visit other EPA pages to learn more about the EPA's national Inventory and how it relates to EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and the EPA's state-level greenhouse gas (GHG) data. The EPA recognizes that there will be differences between the EPA's state-level GHG estimates and some inventory estimates developed independently by individual state governments. Inventory data presented here should not be viewed as official data of any state government. Additional information is available on official state GHG data, where it exists, including information on potential areas of difference between EPA's data and official state data.
