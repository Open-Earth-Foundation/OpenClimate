In this way, the results described in the following chapters are intended to be comparable and acceptable on a global scale.The inventory prepared at the urban scale includes all the emission sources within the realm of authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality. The authority of Denizli Metropolitan Municipality covers the provincial boundaries of the province .The inventory content is based on the classification of emission sources set by GPC. When preparing inventory in the framework of GPC, the scope of the inventory was determined depending on the detail, accuracy and reliability of the available data. GPC evaluates greenhouse gas emissions in 3 scopes; Scope 1 - Direct Emissions, Scope 2 - Indirect Emissions and Scope 3 - Indirect (Consumption Based) Emissions. During the preparation of the inventory, all emission sources within the realm of authority of the municipality were scanned and the maximum amount of data was tried to be reached. The emissions under Scope 3 were not included in the inventory due to the fact that it is ver y difficult to reach related data . According to the results of the GPC approach, the total greenhouse gas emissions of Denizli province for the year 2016 were estimated to be 7.5 million tons of CO2e. This amount refers to 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita, which is proportional to the population of Denizli in the same year (1.005.687) and this number is higher than Turkey’s 2016 average calculated as 7.5 tons of CO2e per capita. Total emissions of Denizli in Turkey’s total emissions in 2016 constitute 1.5%.","CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs, SF6",,,,,,,,,,,,,,12134,1005687,2016,,10/04/2021 09:23:47 AM

Due to current limitations in data availability, the methodology is modeled after the  ‘tier 1’ approach, which provides guidance on how to estimate GHG emissions using relatively aggregated input  data on fuel usage, combined with default emission factors by fuel.  The City does not have a power plant within its geographical boundaries and its electricity is solely sourced from the Manila Electric Company (MERALCO). Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity consumption are classified as indirect or Scope 2 emissions, if the power plants producing the electricity are physically located outside the geographic boundaries of an LGU. For transportation related emissions the methodology is modeled after IPCC’s ‘tier 1’ approach due to current limitations in data availability.  GHG emissions are therefore estimated using relatively aggregated input data on fuel use, combined with default emission factors by fuel.  Only road transportation emissions are included in the GHG inventory since there are no airports or harbors in the geographical boundary of the City of Santa Rosa. For solid wastes, it is based on the First Order Decay method.  Such method recognizes the process by which CH4 and CO2 are formed in solid waste disposal sites, which is through slow decay throughout a few decades of degradable organic components in waste. For the doemstic wastewater, CH4 and N2O emissions were calculated.","CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20, PFCs",,,,,,,,,,,,Increased,Population increase,55,414812,2020,POINT (121.089 14.2843),10/04/2021 09:23:47 AM

It is designated that the 2015 is the base year for emission, however, due to lack of information from past years, some indicators has not been included in this report.  At the community level, the main sources of emissions are the burning of fossil fuels for carbon dioxide emissions, automotive exhaust for nitrous oxide emissions and landfills for methane emissions.   The calculation includes three main sources of GHG emissions: 1) Direct emissions from the burning of fossil fuels 2) Indirect emissions from the production of electricity from electricity generation plants 3) The decomposition of biomass to greenhouse gases in landfills The results are presented into sub-sectors; residential, commercial, industry and agriculture for fuel combustion and electricity usage. The standard unit of “equivalent CO2” is used to report the emissions. All sources have one or more associated emission factors for quantify the energy burned in the all three main sectors - buildings, electricity, on-road transportation, solid waste.  A Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) is a quantification of the amount of CO2 emitted due to energy consumption and waste disposal in the territory of a Local Authority within a given period of time. The BEI allows identifying the main CO2 sources on the municipality’s territory, thus helping to select the appropriate actions to curb emissions.

Deste modo é possível identificar as principais fontes antropogénicas de emissões de dióxido de carbono, utilizando dados que quantificam o consumo energético decorrente da atividade humana, como por exemplo: eletricidade consumida, combustíveis nos transportes e gás natural. Os fatores de emissão são coeficientes que quantificam as emissões por unidade energia consumida, as emissões são estimadas multiplicando um fator de emissão pela quantidade da respetiva forma de energia (ex.

The grey energy of net imported other goods and services is not included in the methodology used by the city of Zurich as there is no specific data available. The methodology does not include emissions from non-energetic sources (e.g. landfills, waste water treatment).  Primary energy, final energy and effective energy: The 2000-watt methodology defines primary energy as the total energy present in the original energy source, plus its grey energy. The energy that reaches the customer, after all conversion and transmission losses, is called final energy. In turn, only a part of this is actually used: the effective energy. The rest is lost as waste heat. Basis for all calculations is the final energy demand.  Territorial principle: Basis of the methodology is the territorial principle. It refers to the energy consumed in the city area and the emissions which occur there. The energy sources grey energy and grey emissions are also taken into account. The grey energy of net imported other goods and service is not included in the 2000 watt society methodology (lack of specific data).

Parallel calculations have been carried out using different methodologies including EU Covenant of Mayors (CoM) methodology and CO2-report as described in detail in Turku’s Climate Plan 2029 (SECAP). For best consistency with the CRF requirements, the data provided here is based on the ALas model (Alueellinen Laskenta, regional calculation) provided by the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE). In broad terms, the calculation is similar to the basic level of GPC standard, with agriculture, F-gases and grid losses included, but without the local air service included in the standard. However, for consistency with baseline data F-gases are excluded from the report below and local air service emissions are included according to the CO2-report.In 2019 Turku reported GHG emissions using the CoM methodology, following the recommendation of CDP representatives. In previous years, another methodology (CO2-report) has been used. The emissions have been estimated for 1990 and 2015 using the CoM methodology, whereas emissions following CO2-report methodology are available for a more comprehensive time-series (1990, 2000, 2008 - 2018). For the time being, ALas model covers the years from 2005 onward.Despite the minor differences in the methodologies and differencies in the update cycle and data coverage, all the models show very similar declining progress towards the carbon neutrality target. We are committed to improve the data and methodologies in collaboration with expert organisations in Finland and beyond.","CH4, CO2, N20",,390100,,353800,,,,,,,,Decreased,Technological change,246,194000,2020,POINT (22.2666 60.4518),10/04/2021 09:23:47 AM

The emission figures are shown with unit CO2 equivalents. This is a unit of measurement used to be able to compare the heating effect of different greenhouse gases on the atmosphere and to clarify which emissions contribute the most to global warming. Under ""Questions and answers"" this is further elaborated.The same methods and data sources are used for all the years covered by the statistics. The first year for which emissions are calculated is 2009. The reason for this is that there is either no data basis, or that the data basis does not have sufficient quality further back in time.The emission accounts use data sources that show the development at the local level to the greatest possible extent. The data sources, and also the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, can therefore vary from the national emission accounts. However, the method for calculations follows the principles in the national emission accounts.link: https://www.miljodirektoratet.no/tjenester/klimagassutslipp-kommuner/?area=430&sector=-2",CO2,,,,,,,,,,,,Decreased,Improved data accuracy,354.6,79559,2020,,10/04/2021 09:23:47 AM

Its analysis covers all of six GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs and PFCs) mentioned in Kyoto protocol, CFCs and water vapor released into the stratosphere by airplanes. The Bilan Carbone accordingly provides an overview on the various emission sources and their contributions to climate change. By employing this method, the GHG emissions from different types of reduction scenarios can be estimated, and thereby helps to identify appropriate and effective action plans and/or policies as well as potential implementation options to reduce GHG emissions.The Bilan Carbone method is somewhat similar to the techniques of “Rapid asessment of sources of air, water and land pollution” which are primarily based on the magnitude of emission sources and emission factors. The cores of Bilan Carbone tool are workbooks and spreadsheets in MS. Excel with ready-made calculating and converting formulas. All emission factors are arranged in a separate spreadsheet and linked to corresponding cells in other ones. Thus, in the event the users add or modify emission factors, the results in associated cells and spreadsheets are altered accordingly.","CH4, CO2, HFCs, N20",510499,3543847,,,,,,,,,,Increased,,1439,1240730,2020,,10/04/2021 09:23:47 AM

The degradation to higher spatial resolution includes a geographical limitation of where the emissions take place (eg road network) and statistics at regional and local level (eg traffic flows, vehicle types, cold start share).

Those inventories follow the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC).1 Wherever possible, modeling of future emissions has been aligned with standards in the GHG inventories to allow the cities to more easily track progress over time. Because the One Climate Future plan is for both cities, the results of the two inventories were combined and input into a single model, and baseline and projected numbers will appear larger than would be expected for either city on its own. The inventories show that both the scale and distribution of emissions between different fuels and sectors are extremely similar in both cities, with a few small exceptions: the industrial sector is larger in South Portland, and Portland has more non-road transportation infrastructure (e.g., Harbor, Jetport).

La forma como se planificó y ejecutó este trabajo se fundamentó principalmente en lasdirectrices del Protocolo Mundial para los Inventarios a Escala Comunitaria de Emisiones deGases de efecto invernadero (GPC, 2006). Esta metodología consideró como variable de entrada la actividad de las categorías de Energía, Desechos Sólidos y Transporte, para distintos gases de efecto invernadero como son el CO2, CH4 y N2O, responsables deaumentar día tras día la problemática del calentamiento global a causa de la duración (años) yelevada concentración radiactiva de estos gases en la atmósfera.  Las estimaciones se realizaronbajo las Directrices del Panel Intergubernamental de Expertos sobre el Cambio Climático (IPCC, por sus siglas en inglés). La información derivada del diagnóstico, provee datosprincipalmente de dos los seis gases considerados en el Anexo A del Protocolo de Kioto. Los gases incluidos son dióxido de carbono (CO2) y metano (CH4) y óxido nitroso (N2O). Estosgases se obtuvieron para tres de las seis categorías o fuentes de emisión establecidas por elIPCC en sus directrices. Las metodologías utilizadas para la realización del presente diagnóstico, son las establecidas de nivel 1, lo que implica que los datos de actividad no cuentan con un alto nivel de desagregación. En algunos sectores y subsectores se logró obtener datos de actividad locales,pero los factores de emisión fueron nacionales o mundiales lo que traduce en mayor incertidumbre. Se especificarán a mayor profundidad los métodos de obtención de información en el apartado de cada sector. Como resultado se obtuvo que las emisiones totales de GEI para el municipio de Mérida fueron de 5,019,245.42 Ton de CO2eq en el 2016. La mayor contribución de las emisiones totales en el municipio de Mérida, proviene del sectortransporte que anualmente aporta en promedio el 71% de los GEI, seguida del sector energía con 21%, y finalmente desechos con el 8%.","CH4, CO2, N20",,,,,,,,,,,,Increased,Population increase,88340,921771,2020,POINT (-89.5926 20.9674),10/04/2021 09:23:47 AM

The PA DEP contracted with ICLEI USA to provide technical assistance for the Township to create the 2018 inventory using  ICLEI ClearPath software and to draft a Climate Action Plan. The 2018 inventory was undertaken during the fall of 2020 and completed during the summer of 2021. The 2018 inventory follows the GPC protocol. Previously, through the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC),  the designated Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Greater Philadelphia Region, the Township relied on DVRPC for its 2005, 2010, and 2015 inventories which have been annually reported to CDP by Abington Township since 2016. DVRPC conducts regional Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories  on a 5-year interval using its own methodology.

They show ""territorial"" emissions, meaning emissions that occur within the UK's borders. The data show emissions allocated on an “end-user” basis where emissions are distributed according to the point of energy consumption (or point of emission if not energy related). Except for the energy industry, emissions from the production of goods are assigned to where the production takes place. Therefore, emissions from the production of goods which are exported will be included, and emissions from the production of goods which are imported are excluded. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main greenhouse gas, accounting for about 80 per cent of the UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. The statistics are largely consistent with the UK national Greenhouse Gas Inventory and with the Devolved Administration Greenhouse Gas Inventories, but there are some minor methodological differences outlined in a methodology report. Reading Borough Council uses a subset of this dataset, called 'Local authority territorial emissions estimates within the scope of influence of local authorities 2005-2019', to measure and report on emissions for the Borough, and to track progress with mitigation efforts, as this gives a more accurate picture of emissions which can be influenced by local action.",CO2,,,,,,,,,,,,Decreased,Technological change,40.4,161780,2019,,10/04/2021 09:23:47 AM

Scopes establish the inventory boundaries so that GHG emissions to be accounted for and reported in the inventory are clearly stated. Boundaries define the scale and reach of emissions that will be included by the LGU in its GHG inventory Report. There are 3 scopes used in the inventory reporting. For Zamboanga city’s 2019 GHG inventory, scopes 1 and 2 activities under the Agriculture, Waste, Industrial Processes and Product Use, Transport, Forestry and other Land Use, and Energy (AWITFE) sectors is accounted. Scope 1: All direct emissions from sources within the geopolitical boundary of the community.Scope 2: Energy-related indirect emissions that occur outside the community boundary as a consequence of consumption/use of grid supplied electricity.Scope 3: All other indirect emissions that occur outside the boundary as a result of activities within the community’s geopolitical boundary, including trans-boundary emissions due to exchange/use/consumption of goods and services.To compute for the numerical values of the sources of emission within Zamboanga city, the general quantification equation was used in computing for GHG emissions:GHG Emission = Activity Data x Emission Factor x Global Warming PotentialActivity Data (A) is any data that pertain to the magnitude of human activity resulting to GHG emissions. These can be volume of fuel (measured in liters), weight of fuel (measured in kilogram units), amount of electricity usage (measured in kilowatt-hour) or distances travelled (measured in kilometers), etc. Emission Factor (EF) is the average emission rate of a given GHG for a given source, relative to units of activity. These are always expressed as ratios.Global Warming Potential (GWP) is the comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1453.27,977234,2020,,10/04/2021 09:23:47 AM
