## Description
This dataset contains 2022 data for states and regions. All data included in the dataset is self reported by states and regions through the [2022 States and Regions Questionnaire](https://guidance.cdp.net/en/guidance?cid=36&ctype=theme&idtype=ThemeID&incchild=1&microsite=0&otype=Questionnaire). Please note that the reporting platform remains open for submissions until the end of the year and the dataset is updated daily to reflect new submissions.

When using the inventory data for aggregation, comparison and trend analysis, please note that the inventory data is based on non-verified self-reported inputs from states and regions. The reported inventory may not include all emission sources within the administrative boundary.
