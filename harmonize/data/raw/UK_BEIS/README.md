**Units**: Data across all tables are reported in kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (kt CO2e) except where noted otherwise. The time period in all tables refers to calander years i.e. January to December. Some cells have no data; when this is the case it is indicated at the top of the table.[x] denotes cells where data are not available We do not have estimates of emissions from agriculture livestock, agriculture soils and landfill prior to 2018, so values are not shown in these cells or in any totals that would include them.

**Description**:
These statistics provide a breakdown of greenhouse gas emissions across the UK, using nationally available datasets going back to 2005. This year emissions estimates for all sectors and gases span the entire timeseries.

The main data sources are the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) National Statistics of energy consumption for local authority areas. All emissions included in the national inventory are covered except those from aviation, shipping and military transport, for which there is no obvious basis for allocation to local areas, and emissions of fluorinated gases, for which suitable data are not available to estimate these emissions at a local level.
