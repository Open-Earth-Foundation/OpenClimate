**Units**: Data across all tables are reported in kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (kt CO2e) except where noted otherwise. The time period in all tables refers to calander years i.e. January to December. Some cells have no data; when this is the case it is indicated at the top of the table.[x] denotes cells where data are not available We do not have estimates of emissions from agriculture livestock, agriculture soils and landfill prior to 2018, so values are not shown in these cells or in any totals that would include them.

**Description**:
This publication combines data from the UK’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory with data from a number of other sources, including local energy consumption statistics, to produce a nationally consistent set of greenhouse emissions estimates at local authority level from 2005 to 2020. They show "territorial" emissions, meaning emissions that occur within the UK's borders. The data show emissions allocated on an “end-user” basis where emissions related to energy use are distributed according to the point of energy consumption. Emissions that are not energy related are distributed based on the point of emission, other than emissions from waste management which are distributed based on where the waste was produced.

Except for the energy industry, emissions from the production of goods are assigned to where the production takes place. Therefore, emissions from the production of goods which are exported will be included, and emissions from the production of goods which are imported are excluded.

The greenhouse gases covered by these statistics are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. This is the first time that this publication has included estimates of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, previously they have only included carbon dioxide emission estimates. In accordance with international reporting and carbon trading protocols, each of these gases is weighted by its global warming potential (GWP), so that total greenhouse gas emissions can be reported on a consistent basis (in carbon dioxide equivalent units). The GWP for each gas is defined as its warming influence relative to that of carbon dioxide. The GWPs used in these statistics are from Working Group 1 of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007.

The UK territorial emission statistics that we publish also cover emissions from hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride (collectively referred to as fluorinated gases or F gases), but we are not able to estimate emissions of these gases at a local authority level at this time. Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide collectively accounted for an estimated 97% of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK in 2020, with F gases making up the remaining 3%.

The statistics are largely consistent with the UK national Greenhouse Gas Inventory and with the Devolved Administration Greenhouse Gas Inventories, but there are some minor methodological differences outlined in the methodology report. Tables 4.1-4.5 show how these local authority estimates reconcile with the national inventories. Following the expansion of this publication to cover methane and nitrous oxide emissions as well as carbon dioxide these tables now cover all greenhouse gases, not just carbon dioxide.
