## Description
The CO2 emissions by IPCC Sectoral Approach are calculated based on Energy consumption data and Emission factors. Please refer to and find method descriptions at Shan et al. (2020) “China CO2 emission accounts 2016-2017. Scientific Data”, Shan et al. (2017) “China CO2 emission accounts 1997-2015.
