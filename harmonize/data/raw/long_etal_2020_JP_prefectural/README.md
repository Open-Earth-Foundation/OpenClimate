## Description
This work contributes to a time-series emission with a record of 47 prefectures in Japan as well as their associated socioeconomic features. The emission inventories that have been compiled are based on three major fossil fuels and 26 sectors with careful emission allocations for regional electricity generation. This dataset is uniformly formatted and can be expected to provide important information to set regional reduction allowances and sectoral reduction priorities.
