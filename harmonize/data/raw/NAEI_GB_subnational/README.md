**Version**:
Issue 4.1: This file contains final estimates of the DA Greenhouse Gas Inventories for 1990-2020, presenting the GHG totals by applying the Global Warming Potentials per GHG that are specified within (i) the IPCC AR4 (as used for national reporting under the Kyoto Protocol), and (ii) the IPCC AR5 (which will be used for international reporting under the Paris Agreement). The underlying emissions data (i.e. kt per gas) have been revised for 2020 since v4.1, reallocating some emissions for power stations from unallocated to Wales.

## Description
This file consolidates state level greenhouse gas (GHG) data published in EPA’s GHG Data Explorer consistent with the national GHG Inventory as published in April 2022 and described in the [Methodology Report: Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks by State: 1990-2020 Methodology Report (EPA-430-R-22-005)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/methodology-report-inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-state-1990-2020)

Generally, emissions from sources of GHGs are shown with positive numbers; removals from sinks are denoted by negative numbers (with some exceptions as per the economic sector tab descriptions below). The units in this consolidated file are million metric tons of CO2 equivalents or CO2e using 100-year GWPs from IPCC’s Fourth Assessment report consistent with the [national Inventory](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-archive) published in April 2022.

The workbook contains three tabs: Data by UNFCCC-IPCC Sectors, Data by Econ Sect, and Annotations.  Each tab is discussed in more detail in the tables below.
