## Description
Climate Mayors, founded in 2014, is a bipartisan, peer-to-peer network of U.S. mayors
working together to demonstrate leadership on climate change through meaningful
actions in their communities, and to express and build political will for effective federal
and global policy action.

Information in the compendium of climate actions is from many Climate Mayors cites that includes:
- Emission reduction targets and dates;
- Signification climate actions and policies; and
- New or recent notable actions from cities.
