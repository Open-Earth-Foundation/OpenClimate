## Description
A daily city-level dataset of fossil fuel and cement CO2 emissions. It provides daily, city-level estimates of emissions from January 2019 through December 2021 for 1500 cities in 46 countries, and disaggregates five sectors: power generation, residential (buildings), industry, ground transportation, and aviation. The goal of this dataset is to improve the timeliness and temporal resolution of city-level emission inventories and includes estimates for both functional urban areas and city administrative areas that are consistent with global and regional totals. It also provides the first estimates for many cities in low-income countries. Such near-real-time CO2 dataset would be of great advantage to further monitoring the human activities and to capture the impacts of COVID-19 for long term.
