## Description
The PRIMAP-hist dataset combines several published datasets to create a comprehensive set of greenhouse gas emission pathways for every country and Kyoto gas, covering the years 1750 to 2022, and almost all UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) member states as well as most non-UNFCCC territories. The data resolves the main IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2006 categories. For CO2, CH4, and N2O subsector data for Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), and Agriculture are available. The "country reported data priority" (CR) scenario of the PRIMAP-hist datset prioritizes data that individual countries report to the UNFCCC. For developed countries, AnnexI in terms of the UNFCCC, this is the data submitted anually in the "common reporting format" (CRF). For developing countries, non-AnnexI in terms of the UNFCCC, this is the data available through the UNFCCC DI interface (di.unfccc.int) with additional country submissions read from pdf and where available xls(x) or csv files. For a list of these submissions please see below. For South Korea the 2022 official GHG inventory has not yet been submitted to the UNFCCC but is included in PRIMAP-hist. PRIMAP-hist also includes official data for Taiwan which is not recognized as a party to the UNFCCC.
