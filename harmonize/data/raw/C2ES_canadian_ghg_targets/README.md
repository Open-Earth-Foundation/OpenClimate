# Description
A greenhouse gas emissions target refers to the emission reduction levels that provinces set out to achieve by a specified time. Under the Paris Agreement, Canada pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Provinces, territories, and the federal government are working toward meeting this goal, and currently, 9 of 10 provinces have implemented economy-wide greenhouse gas targets.

Provinces use a variety of baseline years, ranging from 1990 to 2007, and a range of target years, ranging from 2012 to 2050, although most include a target year of 2050.
