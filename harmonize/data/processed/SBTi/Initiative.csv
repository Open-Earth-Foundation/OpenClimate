SBTi,Science Based Targets initiative,"    Science-based targets provide a clearly-defined pathway    for companies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,    helping prevent the worst impacts of climate change and future-proof business growth. Targets are considered    ‘science-based’ if they are in line with what the latest    climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the    Paris Agreement – limiting global warming to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels    and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.
