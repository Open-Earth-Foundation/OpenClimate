# OpenClimate App

The OpenClimate App is a reference implementation of a Python (ACA-Py) controller and server for issuing verifiable credentials via ACA-Py (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python). 

For an introduction to self-sovereign identity (SSI), please see [Phil Windley's article](https://www.windley.com/archives/2018/09/multi-source_and_self-sovereign_identity.shtml) on the topic.

## Installation

### Separate Module Installation (non-containerized)
If you're running as separate modules not in a containerized context, create a .env File with the following variables specific to your setup:
```
CONTROLLERPORT=3100
AGENTADDRESS='http://AGENT_IP_ADDRESS:8150' (the default agent address is localhost)
WEB_ROOT=https://localhost_or_ip_address_or_domain:port_number_if_necessary/
JWT_SECRET=yoursecrethere (32 alpha-numeric digits, e.g. GGgNz2CVwxBJjhVzHmuKPV3bEJMdViKP)
SESSION_SECRET=yoursecrethere (32 alpha-numeric digits, e.g. y5YSfodHhp6QkbG3IxaqlzcFQXUlZquh)
```

Add the following line to your ACA-Py Agent startup.sh file:
```
--webhook-url "$WEBHOOK_ADDRESS" \
```

Add the controller ip-address (default localhost) and port (default port 3100) in your agent YML file for each agent the following line:
```
WEBHOOK_ADDRESS: http://CONTROLLER_IP_ADDRESS:CONTROLLER_PORT/api/controller-webhook
```

Run the following command to install the needed dependencies
```
npm install
```

Once the controller, agent, and database are all running, you will need to run a one-time startup script, which will also need to be ran everytime the agent and database are reset. This script will set up a public DID for you, provide the TAA for acceptance, and create a credential definition.
```
/bin/bash ./scripts/startupScript.sh
```

_TODO_

* Installing this app and dependencies (including cloud agent, network, etc.)
* OS requirements, etc.
* Quick test to make sure everything is working

## Quickstart

### Separate Module Quickstart (non-containerized) 
Upon installation, run
```
npm run dev

/bin/bash ./scripts/startupScript.sh
```

## Deployment

In the project directory, you can run the following command to build the app for production to the `build` folder:

## Logging

Logs are emitted using the [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) logging package. Each log line is a [JSON](https://json.org/) object, with structured properties. The `level` property indicates the severity of the logged event: `debug`, `info`, `warning` and `error` are the main levels.
