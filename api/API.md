# OpenClimate API

This document covers the OpenClimate v1 API. OpenClimate uses a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)ful API
to provide access to its data, and to support its user interface.

# Servers

There are two public OpenClimate API servers:

- https://openclimate.network/ - public, stable, production environment.
  Use this unless you're a core developer!
- https://openclimate.openearth.dev/ - unstable, development environment.
  Use this for testing new features.

Web UIs run from the roots of these servers, and should use relative links to
access the API.

Out-of-browser apps can switch between them.

It's also possible to run the API server locally; use the local address in this case!

# Overview

## Version

The API uses [semantic versions](https://semver.org/). The major part of the
API version will be in the URL; currently, it's `/v1`.

Backwards-compatible changes like added endpoints, going from unordered to ordered results, or added data per endpoint, will keep the same major version.

Backwards-incompatible changes, like removing endpoints, removing properties returned by an endpoint, or changing the ordering of data, will generate a new major version.

There may be legacy API endpoints not listed here and not covered by semver. Don't use them.

## Status codes

HTTP status codes are used to represent the results of the API call for common values like 400, 404, 500, 304, etc.

## Default result structure

Data in the OpenClimate API is represented as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

All API endpoints return a JSON object with the following top-level information:

- **success**: a Boolean value. False if there was an error. Typically, true if HTTP status code is 2xx or 3xx.
- **message**: a string; when success is false, will give an explanation of  the error.
- **data**: If success is true, this is the data.

# Glossary

- **Actor**: an entity that is responsible for climate action. Examples include countries, regions like states and provinces, cities, private companies, and facilities like farms, office buildings, and factories.

- **Actor ID**: each actor has a unique ID. For countries, it's their 2-letter
ISO 3166-1 code. For states and provinces, it's their ISO 3166-2 code. For
cities, it's their UNLOCODE identifier.

# Endpoints

## Actor endpoints

### Actor parts /api/v1/actor/{actor_id}/parts(?type={part_type})

Returns the parts of an actor that has parts. For a country, it returns the top-level administrative parts, like states or provinces. For a US state, it returns cities and companies in that state.

To filter the results by type, provide the **type** parameter.

#### Output

Standard output. `data` is an array of JSON objects, ordered by `name` property, with the following properties:

- `actor_id`: ID for the part object; good for feeding to this or other API endpoints.
- `name`: name of the part object; good for showing to humans.
- `type`: type of the part object; one of 'planet', 'country', 'adm1', 'adm2', 'city', 'organization', 'site'.
- `has_data`: boolean; says whether there is data available for this actor. Null if unknown.
- `has_children`: boolean; says whether there are parts for this actor. Null if unknown.
- `children_have_data`: boolean; says whether there is data for the parts of this actor. Null if unknown.

### Actor path /api/v1/actor/{actor_id}/path

Returns the path from the root actor 'EARTH' to the Actor, inclusively. The path is in order from the most
specific actor to the most general, for example, searching for Montreal will result in: Montreal, Quebec,
Canada, Earth.

#### Output

Standard output. `data` is an array of JSON objects, ordered by hierarchy from the smallest to the largest,
including the actor.

- `actor_id`: ID for the actor; good for feeding to this or other API endpoints.

## Search endpoints

### Actor search /api/v1/search/actor?name={name}(&language={language})
### Actor search /api/v1/search/actor?identifier={identifier}(&namespace={namespace})
### Actor search /api/v1/search/actor?q={q}

Searches for actors with the given criteria. Must include one of `q`, `name`,
or `identifier`.

With `name`, searches for actors with exact name match. Can be filtered
by `language` to only return actors with that language code.

With `identifier`, searches for actors with exact identifier match. Can be filtered by `namespace` to only return actor identifiers within that namespace.

With `q`, does a full search of identifiers and names that include the
search parameter.

A search with no matches will return a 200 HTTP code, a `success` value of `true`, and a `data` property that is an empty list (see below).

#### Output

  match
